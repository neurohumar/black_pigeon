# About __*Black Pigeon*__

__*Black Pigeon*__ is a simple python script , responsible for hiding various types of data into __PNG__ or __JPEG__ image file to ensure security and privacy.
It typically compresses files to be hidden , with popular LZMA algorithm to reduce size . Besides it uses cryptographic algorithm to encrypt data during hiding process

# Supported Files
1. PNG (.png)
2. JPEG (.jpeg)
3. ZIP (.zip)

# Features 
- Compression
- Decompression
- Encryption
- Decryption
- Steganographic obscuration
- File Injection
- File extration

# Installation

## Step 1 :
```sh
git clone https://github.com/neurohumar/black_pigeon.git
```

## Step 2 :
```sh
cd black_pigeon
```

## Step 3 :
